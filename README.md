# EasierSneak

**A Minecraft mod that revolutionizes sneaking by introducing toggle functionality**

## 🎯 Overview

EasierSneak is a client-side Minecraft mod that transforms the traditional hold-to-sneak mechanic into a convenient toggle system. No more finger strain from holding Shift for extended periods - simply toggle sneak mode on and off with an easy key combination.

## ✨ Features

### 🔄 Toggle Sneak Mode
- **Activate**: Press `Ctrl + Shift` to toggle sneak mode on/off
- **Quick Disable**: Press `Shift` alone while in toggle mode to instantly disable sneaking
- **Visual Feedback**: Your character will remain in sneak position until you disable toggle mode

### 🎮 Gameplay Benefits
- **Reduced Finger Strain**: No more holding Shift for long building sessions
- **Precision Building**: Perfect for detailed construction work at heights
- **Stealth Gameplay**: Ideal for exploring dangerous areas or PvP situations
- **Accessibility**: Makes the game more comfortable for players with mobility issues

### 🌐 Universal Compatibility
- **Client-Side Only**: Works on any server without requiring server-side installation
- **Multiplayer Compatible**: Functions perfectly in both single-player and multiplayer environments
- **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't affect game balance or provide unfair advantages

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Press `Ctrl + Shift`** - Your character enters toggle sneak mode and crouches
2. **Move around normally** - Your character stays crouched without holding any keys
3. **Press `Shift` alone** - Instantly exits toggle mode and returns to normal movement
4. **Press `Ctrl + Shift` again** - Re-enables toggle mode
