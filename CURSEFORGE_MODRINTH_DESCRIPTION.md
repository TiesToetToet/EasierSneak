# EasierSneak

A client-side mod that adds toggle sneak functionality to Minecraft.

## What it does

EasierSneak allows you to toggle sneak mode on and off instead of having to hold the Shift key constantly. This is particularly useful for long building sessions, exploration, or any situation where you need to stay crouched for extended periods.

## Controls

- **Ctrl + Shift**: Toggle sneak mode on/off
- **Shift** (while in toggle mode): Disable sneak mode

## How it works

1. Press Ctrl + Shift to enable toggle sneak mode - your character will crouch and stay crouched
2. Move around normally while remaining in sneak position
3. Press Shift alone to disable toggle mode and return to normal movement
4. Press Ctrl + Shift again to re-enable toggle mode

## Use cases

- **Building**: Stay crouched during construction without finger strain
- **Exploration**: Navigate dangerous terrain safely without holding keys
- **Stealth**: Approach mobs or players while maintaining mobility
- **Accessibility**: Reduces the need to hold keys for extended periods
